# üé® Decentralized NFT Marketplace with Privacy-Preserving Governance

A cutting-edge NFT marketplace built on Ethereum that combines seamless trading with privacy-preserving governance mechanisms, ensuring community-driven decision making while protecting voter privacy.

## üîí Privacy-Preserving Voting

Our marketplace implements a **commit-reveal voting scheme** that ensures complete voter privacy while maintaining transparency and verifiability:

### How It Works:
1. **Commit Phase (7 days)**: Voters submit a cryptographic hash of their vote + random salt
   - Vote remains completely private during this phase
   - No one can see voting patterns or influence outcomes
   - Hash: `keccak256(vote + salt + voter_address)`

2. **Reveal Phase (2 days)**: Voters reveal their actual vote by providing the original vote and salt
   - System verifies the reveal matches the original commit
   - Only then is the vote counted towards the final tally
   - Prevents vote buying and coercion

3. **Execution Phase**: Proposals with sufficient revealed votes are executed
   - Requires minimum 10 revealed votes for validity
   - Simple majority (>50%) needed to pass
   - Automated execution ensures trustless governance

### Privacy Benefits:
- **No vote visibility** during the critical voting period
- **Prevents vote buying** since votes can't be proven during commit phase
- **Eliminates bandwagon effects** by hiding interim results
- **Protects minority voters** from potential retaliation
- **Maintains audit trail** while preserving privacy

## üöÄ Project Vision

To create the most secure, fair, and community-driven NFT marketplace in the decentralized ecosystem. We envision a platform where:

- **Creators retain control** over their digital assets with built-in royalty mechanisms
- **Community governance** drives platform evolution through privacy-preserving voting
- **Zero-knowledge principles** protect user privacy while ensuring transparency
- **Cross-chain compatibility** enables global NFT trading without boundaries
- **Sustainable economics** benefit all stakeholders in the ecosystem

Our ultimate goal is to democratize digital art ownership and create a truly decentralized marketplace that serves the community, not corporate interests.
